      <p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS' ; font-size:25px; color: "white"">I genuinely feel priviledged when I was born in the cutting-edge era of technology.  </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS' ; font-size:16px;margin: 0 7.5%;color: "white"">I am the kind of person who is into video games. Though playing I also spotted out flawed and unfun detail, this positively inspired me the design of being a game creator. As I go along this path, I enjoy the work of story telling through the players' direct experience. It is started at the end of my first year of secondary school, when I brought to school an unofficial game, created on paper. It was more than what I thought, the majority of class surrounded me and asked for a play. The game was not perfection, tons of issues appeared on the play. However, to see the cheer on people's faces, the compliments friends gave me, it was the moment I realise the purpose of my life. I got the direction and the perfect motivation, nevertheless, I did not know how to make the first step. Years later, when I visited Blizzard website and accidentally saw their foundation description. It is astonishing, a game giant was estabished by three unemployed IT graduatees. League of Legend, my favourite game, also has a pathetic origin, groups of talented people live in a dirty room with no money earned for three years in order to create the greatest video game of our time. Those are examplary forerunners, I realised the problem was me of hesitance. I self-learnt to create video since highschool and got some videogames completed. I came to RMIT on purpose of round-shaping my abilities and finding companies who would be along my side. Game creating is a complicated work containing, game design, coding, art work and more, as a result, my expectation is seriously to learn everything since games could be about anything. However, learning of manage risks, optimization and communication are the best decisions.</p>

Since I was a kid, I spent most of my time in the library to read fact and information about any kinds of animals. To me, animals are adorable, exotic and exciting to learn about. They are not human, being around them or just visually in my brains is like a escape from this harsh world. So whenever I feel alone or sad I know I could count on my little dog and cat.<br><br>I am boy of the technology world, I am genuinely into the world of science. However, there is a term that attract me even more, and it is Sci-fi. Personally, Sci-fi is amazing, it is unrealistic and persuasive at the same time. It is the head for any of our development to come, they lead us the more visible future. People look up to stars and ask what is up there, and sci-fi just answer all of them stylishly.<br><br> Things that always make me feel apart and unique from my peers are cartoon. Cartoon is fundamentally crucial to my life, I think it is because it is easier to make animation about scifi, the theme I love. Cartoon is friendlier than other kinds of movie and they are not complicated. Cartoon is built on comics, this means they have been through a rigorous examine to be selected. Up to this day, I watch cartoon more than anything else due to its friendliness.<br><br> Those are excitable and deeply stable in my heart.FYI, if I design any character, it would be a space cartoonish animal as it shows people who I am."

  document.getElementById('123').innerHTML="If I were to pick some hobbies of mine, I would definitely choose drawing, reading, making video games:<br><br>I have just developed drawing skill recently, however, the joy of accomplishment always push my pride and motivation up. This is because I always feel content when I see compliments from other people. Personally, I consider myself as a left-brained thinker and drawing just fills the missing part in me. < the cutie in this picture is me! <br> <br> People say you become a normal person when you learn from a normal teacher and you become an expert when u learn from a professinal and to succeed you need to learn from successful people. And that also explains why I love books which connect me to those achievers. I have been always dreaming of a day standing on top of the mountain like them. It is not about money, it is about myself, food needs the right additives to taste good and so do our lives. Therefore, to have a good life, I believe books would be the apporiate recipe.<br><br>As a child, I lived in my imagination, I crafted paper tanks, warriors, it was a beautiful world. Days by days, I want the world inside me become a reality, and since one day i found Unity a game engine, I was extremely fascinated of what I could do here. I learnt and failed, however, I did not give up and eventually got some projects completed. I do make game everyday maybe a little of drawing or a bit of code, but that is enough as many a mickle makes a muckle, I believe this is the path I will now continue despite any failure.";
