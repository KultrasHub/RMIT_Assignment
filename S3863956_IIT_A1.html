      <p style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS' ; font-size:25px; color: "white"">I genuinely feel priviledged when I was born in the cutting-edge era of technology.  </p>
      <p align="left" style="font-family:'Comic Sans MS' ; font-size:16px;margin: 0 7.5%;color: "white"">I am the kind of person who is into video games. Though playing I also spotted out flawed and unfun detail, this positively inspired me the design of being a game creator. As I go along this path, I enjoy the work of story telling through the players' direct experience. It is started at the end of my first year of secondary school, when I brought to school an unofficial game, created on paper. It was more than what I thought, the majority of class surrounded me and asked for a play. The game was not perfection, tons of issues appeared on the play. However, to see the cheer on people's faces, the compliments friends gave me, it was the moment I realise the purpose of my life. I got the direction and the perfect motivation, nevertheless, I did not know how to make the first step. Years later, when I visited Blizzard website and accidentally saw their foundation description. It is astonishing, a game giant was estabished by three unemployed IT graduatees. League of Legend, my favourite game, also has a pathetic origin, groups of talented people live in a dirty room with no money earned for three years in order to create the greatest video game of our time. Those are examplary forerunners, I realised the problem was me of hesitance. I self-learnt to create video since highschool and got some videogames completed. I came to RMIT on purpose of round-shaping my abilities and finding companies who would be along my side. Game creating is a complicated work containing, game design, coding, art work and more, as a result, my expectation is seriously to learn everything since games could be about anything. However, learning of manage risks, optimization and communication are the best decisions.</p>

  ðŸŒ‘PLANET: IJ- Ideal Job
</strong>
<p>
From the book called RICH DAD POOR DAD by Robert T.Kiyosaki, I learnt that rich people do not find jobs, they buy jobs. This is a huge influence to me, I am less attracted to jobs. Additionally, I love creating games and I always wonder if I were in a game enterprise, would I know all of the concept, aspect of the games about or just code. The doubt in me grow bigger gradually, that I do not genuinely want to have a job by other. I feel like it is not what I want, therefore, I come up with a different plan, self-employed business. In other words, my chosen job is game creator, I could cooperate with people, I could manage the time table and even live my favorite lifestyle, the nomadic lifestyle. My decisions is not surely great like it sounds ,however, my happiness and sense of accomplishment do not come from completing a script of code, it is from the completion of artwork like videogames. Another reason for self-employment is earning money by the passion is enjoyable. This is because I work to learn, improve skills and try master every aspect of the work, eventually reach the higher chance of success. This meaningful process also increase my productivity, I concentrate better when I perform job with the utmost interest.
</p>
<p>
My wanted position is lead game designer. It is the work I could show people my ideas, my stories. This is the job that I do not have to think rigorously like programming, being a game designer allows me to learn differently and widely. I would be able to think creatively and this is crucial because creativity relates to happiness alot. Another reason is game designer plays games, literally, fun and work overlap. I think it is suitable for me as I actually like to try lots of games and find what is missing there.
</p>
<p>
A core requirement for a game designer is communication. Being a introvert, I genuinely like listenning to people and this suits the job is that I have to listen from others. Game Designer is not compulsorily a people giving concept, in fact, all people could come with extraordinary concepts, therefore, listenning is important as my decisions affect. the future of the game. Secondly, it is the job that I have to make people share the same vision. For example, programmers and artists may have two opposite ways of approaching problem and a game designer would need to find the approriate path.
</p>
<p>
I am into both programming and art at the same time, in  other words, I would be more able to approach solutions in both program and art style. I know how to generate creative ideas, I sometimes come up with innovative ideas. And I am adaptive to learn new non-technical things.
</p>
<p>
To obtain the wanted position, I would have to improve my persuasion skill, learn how to get people's attention and gain authority. This would be the most essential ability to learn if I want to be a leader. To be a good designer, I also need to have comprehension of literature, myth, religions and more. Furthermore,iconicism is also important to be creative. For example, speaking of a cat, people tend to think of its food is a fish more likely than meat, and to be selective in picking an iconic part for a character in considerable.

  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%">
    INTJ stands for Introversion, Sensing, Thinking and Judging. In explanation, INTJs carefully plan and enjoy well-organized life. People carrying this trait are also realistic and resposible. They approach solutions logically and take steady pace toward goal, they are rarely distracted which makes them truthworthy. Normally, I do not require order in life, I follow habbit but I am also willing to change it any time. However, when it comes at work or study, I have a clear defined schedules, and strong focus on task. Therefore, in group project, I am usually chosen as leader( also carrier). I also exert tremendous energy to work I view as valuable, and evite time-wasting on task I consider unpractical, this could save the team's time.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%">
    Tactile learners learn from touching and doing. It is true that I remember by experience and physical movement. I am extremely impatient toward verbal or writen introduction and inclined to involve in action. This potentially makes me a quicker learner by jumping right into the work, however, with the shortage of information I may get loss at some points. I also expressed myself with body language during conversation. Beside, I also have high score of visual learner. It is because I watch document and books for learning intangible objects like scifi. A daily iconic behaviour of mine could be that I go to Pinterest.com in order to look for ideas and creative work.
  </p>
  <p style="margin-left:5%;margin-right:5%">
  72 is above average, the graph of mine favors curiosity a lots, which I think is true, as I am eaisly impressed and drawn. I like to learn how physics and chemistry work in theory, I love to understand science and concept beyond that. Therefore, in the teamwork, I would be curious of other people's characteristics so that I think it would help assign work.

    Overview
  </strong>
  <ul style="line-height:30px">
    My project idea is about video game, it is a 2D mobile open world game. The elementary concept is similar to "Hungry Shark where players move freely and eat others fish to survive and fill gold rush bar. The difference is the project's theme is about sci-fi, and players control their ship in space. Therefore, the play style is shifted as space ship could be upgrade and players would scout planets and destroy bots' spaceship to get the components for upgradation. The most fun part which is going frenzy after stacking enough power.
  </ul>
  <strong style="font-size:12px;color:#F5B041">
    Motivation
  </strong>
  <ul style="line-height:30px">
    Statisitcally, Hungry Shark is a successful game and highly rated. Additionally, Scifi the a favourable and marvelous theme, it plays a role of envisionment the future. With the shortage of scifi games in the market, it is also easier to get attention from the community. The hook of the game is developed from the Hungry Shark, which are exploration and the gold frenzy. Moreover, getting items and combining them are also an interesting consideration, normally people enjoy being crafty, therefore, the items combination will be attractive to people.
  </ul>
  <strong style="font-size:12px;color:#F5B041">
    Description
  </strong>
  <ul style="line-height:30px">
    Starting with the story, after reading guliver's travel, a young children wondered if he could ever find a tiny island. Following his father's suggestion, "some where in the outer space", he then set his new dream. For many years later, the young man become a famous astronaut, and here he spaces on. The games surround this character, his crews and AI. Throughout the game, players experience a liveful space, with some iconic and exotic region of the universe, the blackhole, the white hole, neutron stars, and beyond our knowledge. There will be the presence of megastructure such as the Dyson sphere, the ring world and dramatically, life in the void emerges here. To create a more diversity of environment in space, the twelves zodiac is divided in two groups: Celestial and Dark space or know as Corrupted celestial. Another iconic feature of the game is item combination, players would find random pieces of equipment all over the space. By scanning planets, destroying enemies's ship, items would randomly drop from there. There are four categories of equipment: Attachor, Utility, Offence and Defence. The combination system is simple, the main ship and attachor equipment are in square shape, which have four sides. Other non-attachor components must be attached to the main ship or attachors. For every non-attachor component to be attached, it requires one available side of the main ship of attachor. Here is how it works:
  </ul>
  <img src="SpaceSheet.png" class="spaceSheet">
  <ul>
    The open map is divided into small regions, and will be loaded or unloaded by trigger method. This increases performance and quality of the game. The feature that is kept from HungryShark is the gold frenzy. In detail, after finishing killing an enemy or scanning a planet players receive an amount of energy, at full charge, gold frenzy is activated. During this process, the spaceship is immune to any damage and gains adaptive power to attack one-level-higher enemies. This burst of energy runs out but will recharge by killing enemies and scanning. This feature boosts speed of the game. The second frenzy is megafrenzy, the spaceship grows in size, and power, score and gold earned would multiply during this frenzy, this will satisfy the hunger of hunting large enemies of low level players.
  </ul>
  <ul>
    In the shop, players would buy higher-quality ships, which have higher level limits, high capacity and more attractive appearance. The main currency is golden coin, which is called gold, it is earned from playing. The second accepted currency is diamond earned from purchasing by real money or rarely dropped from monsters in games. As diamond rarely appeared, they are valuable and can be used in exchange for amazing subsidary equipment such as skins, decorations and loots. To increase the level of exploration, adding treasures and hidden paths inside the game would be a consideration. Treasure works similar to loots but different items. In term of monetization, players will also be able watch rewards ads to boost the game process faster.
  </ul>

  <strong style="font-size:12px;color:#F5B041">
    Tools
  </strong>
  <ul>
    Unity: core engine tool for creating the game, Unity excels at compressing graphics, meaning it provide better performance for mobile game.
  <br>Photoshop: tool for graphics design, Photoshop excels at creating 2D static objects, such as environment and wallpaper or loading scene.
  <br> Visual Studio: professional tool for programming.
  <br>Adobe Animate: tool for character design and animation, this tool outperforms other 2D animation program when it comes to cartoon animation.
  <br>After Effect: creating VFX,VFX plays a significant role in graphic.
  <br>Youtube, Netflix, Pinterest: source for galatic concepts.
  <br>Sound: design will be decided later.
</ul>
<strong style="font-size:12px;color:#F5B041">
  Skill required
</strong>
  <ul >
    With the help of Unity, there wont be requirement for writing new softwares.
    <br>Skills involve: programming in C#, photoshop skills, cartoon drawing abilities, animating skills, level designing, testing skills.
    <br> Extra abilities involve: story telling, optimization and management skills, analysis skill.
    <br>No extra hardware demanded, howerver, execpt from Unity and social media, other softwares are free-trial only. Yet, rmit facility contain those already.
    <br>My current level covers all the skills needed, however, solo development would take time. Therefore, it safe to say the project is feasible, especially when wokring on team.
  </ul>
  <strong style="font-size:12px;color:#F5B041">
    Out come
  </strong>
<ul tyle="line-height:30px">
  Even after the completion, it would also needs to go through trials. Marketting startergy is also required to be successful. As it's an entertain applicant, there would not cause any influence to the community. However, Sci-fi theme makes people feel daily life mundane by letting life in its universe seem marvelous. This is not a negative impact as it allows people to live in their imagination more and all of this result in a deeper comprehension of technology and the unseen world. Chilren, who are believed to account for the majority of consumer, may stay more curious of the technology.

Since I was a kid, I spent most of my time in the library to read fact and information about any kinds of animals. To me, animals are adorable, exotic and exciting to learn about. They are not human, being around them or just visually in my brains is like a escape from this harsh world. So whenever I feel alone or sad I know I could count on my little dog and cat.<br><br>I am boy of the technology world, I am genuinely into the world of science. However, there is a term that attract me even more, and it is Sci-fi. Personally, Sci-fi is amazing, it is unrealistic and persuasive at the same time. It is the head for any of our development to come, they lead us the more visible future. People look up to stars and ask what is up there, and sci-fi just answer all of them stylishly.<br><br> Things that always make me feel apart and unique from my peers are cartoon. Cartoon is fundamentally crucial to my life, I think it is because it is easier to make animation about scifi, the theme I love. Cartoon is friendlier than other kinds of movie and they are not complicated. Cartoon is built on comics, this means they have been through a rigorous examine to be selected. Up to this day, I watch cartoon more than anything else due to its friendliness.<br><br> Those are excitable and deeply stable in my heart.FYI, if I design any character, it would be a space cartoonish animal as it shows people who I am."

This is because I always feel content when I see compliments from other people. Personally, I consider myself as a left-brained thinker and drawing just fills the missing part in me. < the cutie in this picture is me! <br> <br> People say you become a normal person when you learn from a normal teacher and you become an expert when u learn from a professinal and to succeed you need to learn from successful people. And that also explains why I love books which connect me to those achievers. I have been always dreaming of a day standing on top of the mountain like them. It is not about money, it is about myself, food needs the right additives to taste good and so do our lives. Therefore, to have a good life, I believe books would be the apporiate recipe.<br><br>As a child, I lived in my imagination, I crafted paper tanks, warriors, it was a beautiful world. Days by days, I want the world inside me become a reality, and since one day i found Unity a game engine, I was extremely fascinated of what I could do here. I learnt and failed, however, I did not give up and eventually got some projects completed. I do make game everyday maybe a little of drawing or a bit of code, but that is enough as many a mickle makes a muckle, I believe this is the path I will now continue despite any failure.";
